    ### ORM Patterns: The Trade-Offs of Active Record and Data Mappers for Object-Relational Mapping


        What is an Object-Relation Mapper (ORM)?

            In order to iteract with a relational DB in an OOP fashion, we need to 
            create and store objects in it and the ORM is a system that allows us to 
            do that (create and store) and to retrieve them from the DB

            Among ORMs, there are a two very common philosophies or patterns: 

                Active Record 
                    
                    and 
                    
                Data Mapper.


        Benefits of using an ORM

            Real entities you can manipulate and pass around in your code.

                ! database entities = 
                
                An entity is any object in the system that we 
                want to model and store information about. The entitiy is the conceptual
                representation of a table, the table is the physical construct in the database

            less SQL/less boilerplate

        Downsides of ORM

            Less SQL/boilerplate code can be more confusing
